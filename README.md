# Emojify
### Emojify your phrase as you type

### Examples
* Smile on your candid camera -> 😄 on your candid 📷
* Lit fire at the mountain place -> Lit 🔥 at the ⛰️ place


# Goals
* [x] Get input text field where users can add text
* [x] As the user types, when they press space
  * [x] Replace the emoji word with valid emojis
  * [x] Randomise the valid emojis from the list of similar emoji for a word
* [x] Use context API
  * [x] Provider
  * [x] Consumer
* [x] Get list of emojis

# Bugs
* [x] keyup event in mozilla
* [ ] On android devices all character keycode is 299. So spacebar doesnt trigger the emojify function but 'Enter' does
  * [ ] Find solution for listening spacebar event on android
  * [ ] Trigger emojify on every key event (Risky but will also add feature of having emojis in substring words like ``` fireplace -> 🔥place```)
